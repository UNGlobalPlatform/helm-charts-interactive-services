# One-time infrastructure manifest for shared Spark executor namespace.
# Apply once per cluster: kubectl apply -f spark-executors-namespace.yaml
#
# After applying, update the IAM trust policy for emr-job-execution-role
# to include: system:serviceaccount:spark-executors:spark-executor-sa
#
# The RoleBinding grants all ServiceAccounts (system:serviceaccounts group)
# permission to manage pods in this namespace. This is safe because:
# - The Role is namespace-scoped (spark-executors only)
# - The namespace contains only transient executor pods
